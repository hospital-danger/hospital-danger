          <h2>Judy&rsquo;s Story</h2>
          <section class="left">
            <p>Judy Gaines hoped a knee replacement would make her life better. Instead, it has tortured her.</p>
            <p>After her July 2010 surgery, an infection set in and ran roughshod. Bacteria consumed bones and flesh in her leg until doctors had to remove her new artificial knee. They inserted antibiotic chips in the space where the knee should have been. For almost four months, a microbial battle waged in her leg.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="right">
            <p>In that time, Gaines had no knee. She sat in a wheelchair, her left leg locked in a brace to keep the empty socket from folding in on itself. Her sister and best friend, Claire, helped care for her.</p>
            <p>Gaines couldn&rsquo;t bend her leg to get in a car, so she needed an ambulance for doctor visits. Wheeling about home required wide berth &ndash; to avoid jarring the leg on a cabinet or chair, causing blinding pain.</p>
            <p>Once when Gaines was alone, she fell out of the wheelchair. She had to call emergency workers for help.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="left">
            <p>Infections acquired at the hospital are one of the most common problems with knee replacements. Gaines realized she had one just days after she returned home. Doctors did emergency surgery to try and scrape the infection out. Months of physical therapy followed, but the infection persisted, eating away at the bone in her lower leg until it fractured in February 2011.
            <p>Gaines spent the next five months in a wheelchair. She gamely spent more weeks in physical therapy &shy;&ndash; and was able to walk again &ndash; until the artificial knee became unstable, again from the infection, her medical records show. She couldn&rsquo;t take a step without excruciating pain.
          </section>
          <section class="right">
            <p>It took many more months to find a surgeon with the skills to fix the problem. One doctor looked and said he would have to amputate, the sisters say. They did not go back.
            <p>In May 2012, Gaines went to a new facility, the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. Doctors there said they could save her leg and that she would be able to walk again. That August, they removed the original knee replacement, and in November, put in a new knee and graft to replace lost bone.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="left">
            <p>Gaines went home from rehab in January, only to suffer an accident in which she fell and hit her head, requiring another surgery. She is in therapy and learning to walk again, but is expected to fully recover.</p>
            <p>Among the lessons Gaines says she learned is that there&rsquo;s no such thing as a routine surgery. &ldquo;Any operation is dangerous,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an assault to your body no matter how you look at it.&rdquo;</p>

            <h2>Case Study: Preventable Complications, a Hospital&rsquo;s Response</h2>
            <p>In July 2011, Sharon Van Putten was admitted to a Virginia hospital with leg weakness, back pain and what would eventually be diagnosed as lung cancer. While there, she developed a pressure sore&mdash;something experts say should never happen in a hospital&mdash;that tore away flesh as deep as her tailbone.</p>

        <h2>Test Case</h2>
        <p>In theory, the courts are a place where people who&rsquo;ve suffered harm can seek compensation. But it&rsquo;s harder than you might think.</p>
        <p>Some patients suffer injuries that are not clearly negligent; others can&rsquo;t prove economic losses high enough to make it worthwhile for an attorney to take their case, according to a recent <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/698248-emory-med-mal-study.html" target="_blank">Emory University study</a>.</p>
        <p>How does it play out? Create a test case by answering the questions, then see the result.</p>
