          <h2>Judy&rsquo;s Story</h2>
          <section class="left">
            <p>Judy Gaines hoped a knee replacement would make her life better. Instead, it has tortured her.</p>
            <p>After the July 2010 surgery, an infection set in and ran roughshod. Bacteria consumed bones and flesh in her leg until doctors had to remove her new artificial knee. They inserted antibiotic chips in the space where the knee should have been. For almost four months, a microbial battle waged in her leg.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="right">
            <p>In that time, Gaines had no knee. She sat in a wheelchair, her left leg locked in a brace to keep the empty socket from folding in on itself. Her sister and best friend, Claire, helped care for her.</p>
            <p>Gaines couldn&rsquo;t bend her leg to get in a car, so she needed an ambulance for doctor visits. Wheeling about home required wide berth &ndash; to avoid jarring the leg on a cabinet or chair, causing blinding pain.</p>
            <p>Once when Gaines was alone, she fell out of the wheelchair. She had to call emergency workers for help.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="left">
            <p>Infections acquired at the hospital are one of the most common problems with knee replacements. Gaines realized she had one just days after she returned home. Doctors did emergency surgery to try and scrape the infection out. Months of physical therapy followed, but the infection persisted, eating away at the bone in her lower leg until it fractured in February 2011.
            <p>Gaines spent the next five months in a wheelchair. She gamely spent more weeks in physical therapy &shy;&ndash; and was able to walk again &ndash; until the artificial knee became unstable, again from the infection, her medical records show. She couldn&rsquo;t take a step without excruciating pain.
          </section>
          <section class="right">
            <p>It took many more months to find a surgeon with the skills to fix the problem. One doctor looked and said he would have to amputate, the sisters say. They did not go back.
            <p>In May 2012, Gaines went to a new facility, the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. Doctors there said they could save her leg and that she would be able to walk again. That August, they removed the original knee replacement, and in November, put in a new knee and graft to replace lost bone.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="left">
            <p>Gaines went home from rehab in January, only to suffer an accident in which she fell and hit her head, requiring another surgery. She is in therapy and learning to walk again, but is expected to fully recover.</p>
            <p>Among the lessons Gaines says she learned is that there&rsquo;s no such thing as a routine surgery. &ldquo;Any operation is dangerous,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an assault to your body no matter how you look at it.&rdquo;</p>

            Van Putten is admitted with leg weakness and back pain.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
          <strong>July 2, 2011 </strong>
          <p>
            Van Putten has spinal surgery. Records show skin on Van Putten’s lower back shows signs of breaking down. It’s red and warm to the touch.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
          <strong>July 8, 2011 </strong>
          <p>
            Van Putten’s shows a 5 cm &times; 4 cm bedsore, red with small blisters.
            <q>Investigator: Patient was at “high risk” for pressure ulcers (bedsore), but they “should not occur in a hospital setting if proper precautions and care are rendered.”</q>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
          <strong>July 19, 2011 </strong>
          <p>
            Van Putten’s sore is 6 cm &times; 3 cm and contains dead tissue. Records show the wound may not have been accurately measured.
            <q>Investigator: Proper assessment “would have provided nurses and doctors with a tool to easily evaluate and monitor the healing” of the wounds.</q>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
          <strong>August 29, 2011 </strong>
          <p>
            Having been previously released, Van Putten returns to the hospital with various symptoms. The pressure sore is smaller, but still present.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
          <strong>September 20&ndash;26 , 2011</strong>
          <p>
            Van Putten’s wound doubles in size since her readmission. It’s now 6 cm long.
            <q>Investigator: “…wound assessment was not clearly documented by the certified wound nurse.”</q>
            <q>Investigator: “This likely could have been a preventable complication.”</q>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
          <strong>Nov. 8, 2011</strong>
          <p>
            After being admitted to a different hospital, lab results show the pressure sore has become infected with an antibiotic resistant bacteria. Van Putten develops a bloodstream infection.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="event">
          <strong>Nov. 11, 2011</strong>
          <p>
            Van Putten dies of lung cancer. An autopsy says infection from the bedsore was a contributing factor.
            <q>Investigator: “...the services received <strong>did not</strong> meet all applicable professionally recognized standards of healthcare.”</q>
          </p>

          All care and tests provided to Mrs. Van Putten were in accordance with the professional judgment of the clinicians involved and Inova believes such care was appropriate.
